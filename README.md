# Anagram


I have chosen to use Python3 for the anagram challenge. Please enter the file path for the dictionary in quotes after anagram.py or optimizedAnagram.py from the terminal. 

I have decided to sort the words in the dictionary by word length and store them in a dictionary with the key being the integer representing word length and the value being the corresponding list of words with that length from the dictionary. While this takes longer to load and sort, the run times of finding the anagrams is much faster since the n is divided significantly and the entirety of the dictionary does not have to be searched through each time.
